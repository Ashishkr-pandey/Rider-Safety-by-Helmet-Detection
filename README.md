# Rider-Safety_Helmet-Detection
To detect helmets in real-time

This project Road Safety by Helmet Detection is build for Ensuring road safety in vehicle industry. The system 
can identify motorcyclists whether he /she is wearing helmet or not and if he did not wears helmet the motorcycle 
will not get start. The model can be trained on a large data set of annotated images to learn the features that 
distinguish helmets from other objects in the scene. The idea is to make wearing helmet mandatory, which can be 
done by implementation of setting a security factor in the bike which would not allow the rider to ride the bike 
without wearing a helmet. Which would eventually reduce the death cases in case of bike riders accident. The 
proposed system can be integrated with existing traffic monitoring systems. Our key objective is to avoid adding 
any sensors to the helmet because doing so will weaken the helmet and maybe reduce comfort, making it easy to 
implement and cost-effective. Several experiments and evaluations have shown the effectiveness and efficiency 
of this approach in ensuring road safety by promoting the use of helmets. Thus, this system is an essential tool for 
promoting safer driving habits and reducing the number of accidents and fatalities on roads. Our project uses 
YOLO approach, python dark net and open computer vision library.



You would need:


* yolov3-obj_2400.weights which you need to download from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kUkNlw4ejTgwcfOWYqCGEe3kFoIPG0jG and copy to the root of the project

* pip install opencv-python

That should be it!
